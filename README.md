# HTMLSucks

SO basically the idea here is to do away with the fickle nature of HTML and substitute something more programatic. 
-January 2017

Goals: Do everything with fixed elements like a video game rendering engine. Change the view by hand rather than depending on the browser.

Use little to no css classes.
Make a majority of CSS unneeded by giving basic placement capacity. 
Get it to tear down and rebuild everything after a scroll :) And make it fast if possible.
